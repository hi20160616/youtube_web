Channel قناة الجزيرة","description":"صوت للقصة الأكثر إلهاماً عبر زيارة الموقع: https://inspiringstories.aljazeera.com/​\r\n\r\n===================\r\nأطلق الطالب السوداني علي أحمد علي دياب مبادرة تهدف إلى استغلال المساحات المنزلية في زراعة المحاصيل من خضر وفاكهة وغيرها، وذلك لمواجهة غلاء الأسعار وارتفاع تكاليف المعيشة والأزمة الاقتصادية التي يعاني منها السودان. ويؤمل دياب الذي يدرس بكلية علوم الحاسوب وتقانة المعلومات أن تقود مبادرته إلى الوصول للاكتفاء الذاتي عبر زراعة المحاصيل من خلال المجتمعات ومن داخل البيوت\r\n\r\nوكان السودان في الفترة الأخيرة شهد تضخما كبيرا وارتفاعا في السلع الاستهلاكية، ويعتبر دياب أن الزراعة هي المخرج من الأزمة الاقتصادية الراهنة في البلاد ويقول إن مبادرته تهتم بالزراعة المنزلية لتحقيق الاكتفاء الذاتي للمساعدة في إنعاش اقتصاد البلاد\r\n\r\nوتولدت فكرة مبادرة علي التي اطلق عليها اسم ” بيتنا أخضر” من رحم الحجر المنزلي في إطار التقليل من انتشار جائحة كورونا عام 2020 ويقول: ” حينما بدأت جائحة كورونا بالانتشار زادت الأزمة الاقتصادية وسببت مشكلة في القوت اليومي للناس، لأن توفير سلة الخضار اليومي يحتاج لمبالغ كبيرة من المال”\r\n\r\nويضيف علي ” بعد أن تم تعليق الدراسة بالجامعة بسبب جائحة كورونا ذهبنا إلى منازلنا وكان هناك وقت فراغ كبير،  لذا بدأنا نزرع وفي فترة وجيزة جداً وخلال 40-45 يوم بدأنا نُنتج وبدأنا الحصاد من خلال زراعتنا المنزلية وجدنا الحلّ وأرى أن الحل الرئيسي للأزمة الاقتصادية موجود في الزراعة”\r\n\r\nتطورت الفكرة من بعد ذلك لتنتقل لجيرانه وجيران جيرانه حتى تبلورت وتحورت إلى مبادرة أشمل يُريد لها أن تعم الحضر كما الريف فطفق علي يبشر وينشر عن تجربته ومبادرته على مواقع التواصل الاجتماعي وهناك حصد اعجابا وتفاعلا كبيرين يقول دياب: ”

https://inspiringstories.aljazeera.com/​\r\n\r\n===================\r\nأطلق الطالب السوداني علي أحمد علي دياب مبادرة تهدف إلى استغلال المساحات المنزلية في زراعة المحاصيل من خضر وفاكهة وغيرها، وذلك لمواجهة غلاء الأسعار وارتفاع تكاليف المعيشة والأزمة الاقتصادية التي يعاني منها السودان. ويؤمل دياب الذي يدرس بكلية علوم الحاسوب وتقانة المعلومات أن تقود مبادرته إلى الوصول للاكتفاء الذاتي عبر زراعة المحاصيل من خلال المجتمعات ومن داخل البيوت\r\n\r\nوكان السودان في الفترة الأخيرة شهد تضخما كبيرا وارتفاعا في السلع الاستهلاكية، ويعتبر دياب أن الزراعة هي المخرج من الأزمة الاقتصادية الراهنة في البلاد ويقول إن مبادرته تهتم بالزراعة المنزلية لتحقيق الاكتفاء الذاتي للمساعدة في إنعاش اقتصاد البلاد\r\n\r\nوتولدت فكرة مبادرة علي التي اطلق عليها اسم ” بيتنا أخضر” من رحم الحجر المنزلي في إطار التقليل من انتشار جائحة كورونا عام 2020 ويقول: ” حينما بدأت جائحة كورونا بالانتشار زادت الأزمة الاقتصادية وسببت مشكلة في القوت اليومي للناس، لأن توفير سلة الخضار اليومي يحتاج لمبالغ كبيرة من المال”\r\n\r\nويضيف علي ” بعد أن تم تعليق الدراسة بالجامعة بسبب جائحة كورونا ذهبنا إلى منازلنا وكان هناك وقت فراغ كبير،  لذا بدأنا نزرع وفي فترة وجيزة جداً وخلال 40-45 يوم بدأنا نُنتج وبدأنا الحصاد من خلال زراعتنا المنزلية وجدنا الحلّ وأرى أن الحل الرئيسي للأزمة الاقتصادية موجود في الزراعة”\r\n\r\nتطورت الفكرة من بعد ذلك لتنتقل لجيرانه وجيران جيرانه حتى تبلورت وتحورت إلى مبادرة أشمل يُريد لها أن تعم الحضر كما الريف فطفق علي يبشر وينشر عن تجربته ومبادرته على مواقع التواصل الاجتماعي وهناك حصد اعجابا وتفاعلا كبيرين يقول دياب: ” بدأنا مباشرة في فكرة الزراعة المنزلية وأنشأنا مبادرة سميناها بيتنا أخضر ومن أول منشور على فيسبوك قلت فيه أريد أن أُنشئ مبادرة بهذا المفهوم فأُعجب الناس بالفكرة وأعلنوا دعمها ومباشرةً جاء الدعم وتبرع الناس بأشياء عديدة”\r\n\r\nبدأ دياب بمشروعه بكد واجتهاد وأصبح يوفر عبر مبادرته هذه للأسر البذور الجيدة ويقدم لهم دورات تدريبية على زراعة المحاصيل وكيفية العناية بها، وتم استهداف العشرات من الأسر في بادئ  الأمر وتوسع عمل مبادرته أكثر فأكثر\r\n\r\nيقول عادل إبراهيم وهو معلم بمرحلة

The underlying mechanisms stoking new-onset diabetes aren’t clear, though some doctors suspect the SARS-CoV-2 virus may damage the pancreas, the gland that makes insulin which is needed to convert blood-sugar into energy. Sedentary lifestyles brought on by lockdowns could also be playing a role, as might late diagnoses after people avoided doctors’ offices. Even some children’s mild coronavirus cases can be followed by the swift onset of diabetes, scientists found.\n\nConsidered exclusively a lung disease in the early days of the pandemic, Covid-19 is increasingly recognized for its ability to ravage multiple organs and bodily systems, causing persistent and sometimes debilitating symptoms in 1 in 10 sufferers months after their apparent recovery.\n\nLingering metabolic complications, sometimes requiring high doses of insulin, suggest a subset of survivors are developing diabetes - swelling the ranks of the more than the 463 million people living with the chronic condition.\n\nThe disease, in which the body fails to produce enough or properly use insulin, cost an estimated $760 billion in the year before Covid struck, driven by life-shortening complications spanning stroke and kidney failure to foot ulcers and blindness.\n\n“We have a risk of seeing a clash of two pandemics,” said Francesco Rubino, chair of metabolic and bariatric surgery at King’s College London, who set up a global registry of Covid-related diabetes cases with Paul Zimmet, a professor of diabetes at Melbourne’s Monash University.\n\nResearchers have hypothesized pathways in which Covid might increase the likelihood of a diabetes diagnosis, including the possibility that the pancreas’s insulin-excreting beta cells are destroyed either by the virus or by the body’s response to the infection.\n\nOther explanations may include an acute stress response to the infection, the use of steroid treatments that help survival but increase blood-sugar, or just the unmasking of diabetes cases that had previously escaped diagnosis, according to John Nicholls, a clinical professor of pathology at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nAlmost 500 doctors from around the world have agreed to share data via Rubino’s diabetes registry. They will upload patients’ known risk factors, lab results, clinical features, treatment, and disease course - information that will help identify the most prevalent form of the disease, possible causes, and likely prognoses.\n\nSo far, close to 350 cases have been documented through the registry and descriptive anecdotes are flowing in almost every day through emails from concerned patients and parents.\n\nIn Los Angeles, meantime, doctors report a worrying pattern among children with new cases of type-2 diabetes - the chronic form linked to obesity and sedentary lifestyles that’s mainly seen in adults.\n\nThey found one in five new pediatric type-2 cases last year required hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis, a dangerous buildup of acid in the blood due to inadequate insulin supply. By contrast, only 3% of new patients faced this life-threatening problem in 2019. While none of the children in 2020 had active Covid-19, doctors weren’t systematically testing for a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of those who were tested, a third were positive.\n\nDoctors in Canada suggest a drop in utilization of medical services during the pandemic might have delayed care for children with new-onset type 1 diabetes - the rarer form caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. A study from Alberta province found the incidence of severe diabetic ketoacidosis in these patients more than doubled to 27% in 2020.\n\nRubino aims to publish initial findings from the diabetes registry data mid-year, and offers a word of early caution already: there’s enough evidence of Covid-19’s long-term consequences that it should be avoided at any age.\n\n“This is not just a flu that, OK, you’ve got it and you’re done with it,” he said. “You might not be done.

Fully diluted to include employee stock options and restricted stock units, the company is valued at almost $2.5 billion.\n\nHonest and its existing stockholders raised $413 million in Tuesday’s share sale. The company offered 6.5 million shares, with more than 19 million shares sold by investors including private equity firm L Catterton, Institutional Venture Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners and General Catalyst.\n\nAlba, now the company’s chief creative officer, owns 5.65 million shares including options. She didn’t plan to sell her shares in the offering, according to the filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn a letter to potential investors in the company’s filings, Alba touted Honest’s commitment to healthy products. In addition to baby products like shampoos, the company also sells cosmetics as well as cleaning supplies, a collection that was launched during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAlba, who has starred in movies such as “Fantastic Four,” traced her interest in healthy products to her own childhood ailments.\n\n“I suffered from chronic illnesses, severe asthma and allergies, leading to long, lonely weeks in the hospital,” she said. “There were no lasting solutions for my health issues and by the time I was 10, I became aware of how wellness can define your whole life. That’s never left me.”\n\nFounded in 2011, Honest has grown into a national brand and has partnerships with retail giants including Target Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.\n\nAlba has said she became particularly concerned about ingredients in baby products and that she tried to appeal to lawmakers for chemical legislation reform.\n\nHonest’s business touches on several trends that have become more prominent during the coronavirus pandemic, including a focus on wellness and elevated demand for cleaning products. Those have buoyed top-line results for household-goods companies such as Procter \u0026 Gamble Co., the maker of Pampers diapers and Tide laundry detergent.\n\nLos Angeles-based Honest generated sales last year of about $301 million, a 28% increase over 2019.

Fully diluted to include employee stock options and restricted stock units, the company is valued at almost $2.5 billion.\n\nHonest and its existing stockholders raised $413 million in Tuesday’s share sale. The company offered 6.5 million shares, with more than 19 million shares sold by investors including private equity firm L Catterton, Institutional Venture Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners and General Catalyst.\n\nAlba, now the company’s chief creative officer, owns 5.65 million shares including options. She didn’t plan to sell her shares in the offering, according to the filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn a letter to potential investors in the company’s filings, Alba touted Honest’s commitment to healthy products. In addition to baby products like shampoos, the company also sells cosmetics as well as cleaning supplies, a collection that was launched during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAlba, who has starred in movies such as “Fantastic Four,” traced her interest in healthy products to her own childhood ailments.\n\n“I suffered from chronic illnesses, severe asthma and allergies, leading to long, lonely weeks in the hospital,” she said. “There were no lasting solutions for my health issues and by the time I was 10, I became aware of how wellness can define your whole life. That’s never left me.”\n\nFounded in 2011, Honest has grown into a national brand and has partnerships with retail giants including Target Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.\n\nAlba has said she became particularly concerned about ingredients in baby products and that she tried to appeal to lawmakers for chemical legislation reform.\n\nHonest’s business touches on several trends that have become more prominent during the coronavirus pandemic, including a focus on wellness and elevated demand for cleaning products. Those have buoyed top-line results for household-goods companies such as Procter \u0026 Gamble Co., the maker of Pampers diapers and Tide laundry detergent.\n\nLos Angeles-based Honest generated sales last year of about $301 million, a 28% increase over 2019. It lost $14.5 million in 2020. Diapers and wipes accounted for 63% of last year’s sales.\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8Gm\n\nBloomberg Quicktake brings you live global news and original shows spanning business, technology, politics and culture.

Это ознаменовало Великую Победу над фашизмом. Подвиг двух воинов советская власть полностью так и не признала. Лишь спустя десятилетия МИД России официально сообщил, что первыми флаг на фасаде Рейхстага водрузили Кошкарбаев и Булатов. Так свершилась историческая справедливость, передает корреспондент Almaty.tv.   \n\nИмена красноармейцев Рахимжана Кошкарбаева и Григория Булатова теперь навсегда впечатаны в страницу истории - как воинов, которые первыми водрузили знамя Победы на фасаде Рейхстага. В победной схватке в самом сердце Берлина взвод Кошкарбаева уничтожил около 200 вражеских солдат. Пробираясь под градом пуль, сквозь руины разрушенных домов, доблестные воины первыми добрались до фашистской цитадели.\n\n\"Я сказал, Гриша, нам некогда умирать - мы не должны умирать, мы должны при любых обстоятельствах доставить красный штурмовой флаг к Рейхстагу и добиться нам надо, первыми прийти\", - рассказал участник Великой Отечественной войны, Народный герой Казахстана Рахимжан Кошкарбаев. \n\nСпецоперацию по штурму последнего оплота нацистов одновременно выполняли несколько подразделений. По историческим данным, в тот день над Рейхстагом было поднято 20 знамён Победы. За героический подвиг Рахимжану Кошкарбаеву должны были вручить Звезду Героя. Но наградили орденом Боевого Красного Знамени.\n\n\"История в Советском Союзе всегда политизировалась, были коррективы и подвиг этих двух людей остался на втором плане и Знамя Победы официально было признано, что водрузили Георгий Кантария и Михаил Егоров. Сегодня спустя 76 лет восторжествовала историческая справедливость. Многие, многие писали в своих мемуарах, что действительно Георгий Кантария и Михаил Егоров с подачей властей, с подачей командующих водрузили\", - отметил доктор политических наук Саин Борбасов. \n\nПосле возвращения на Родину Рахимжан Кошкарбаев много лет работал на благо страны. Активно занимался общественной деятельностью. За что неоднократно был избран депутатом районного Совета народных депутатов.\n\nПервым руководителем гостиницы Алма-Ата после войны был Рахимжан Кошкарбаев. Здесь офицер Красной армии проработал до конца своей жизни. Об этом напоминает его портрет, занимающий почётное место.\n\nВ кругу семьи фронтовик почти не рассказывал о войне. Современники помнят его как скромного, но очень радушного человека.\n\n\"Это был человек-праздник, он был очень оптимистичным, очень жизнерадостным, у нас постоянно дастархан накрывался по любому поводу.

Осыдан 76 жыл бұрын Берлин түбіндегі шайқаста ер жүрек жауынгерлер Рахымжан Қошқарбаев пен Григорий Булатов жеңіс туын жау төбесінде желбіретті. Бірақ күні бүгінге дейін бұл ерліктің еленбегені белгілі. Тек биыл Ресей тарапы фашистер ордасына қазақ батырының бірінші ту тіккенін мойындап, осылайша тарихи әділеттілік орнады, деп хабарлайды Almaty.tv.\n\n1945 жылы Берлин түбінде фашистік басқыншыларға қарсы ақтық шайқаста Рахымжан Қошқарбаев бастаған взвод 200-ге жуық жауды жер жастандырды. Дәл сол жылдың 30 сәуірде лейтенант Рахымжан Қошқарбаев қасына қатардағы жауынгер Григорий Булатовты ертіп Берлиннің бас ғимаратына қарай беттейді. Бұршақтай жауған оққа қарамастан қайсар жаунгерлер Рейхстагқа бірінші жетіп, фашистер ордасының ғимаратына жеңіс туын желбіреткен. Алайда соғыстан кейін бұл оқиғаның тарихта бұрмаланып кеткені ешкімге жасырын емес.\n\n«Әкем соғыстағы ерлігін елге айтып мақтанып отырмайтын. «Мен батырмын» деп кеуде қақпайтын. Бізді де солай тәрбиеледі. Әрине, 9 мамыр Жеңіс күні тойланған сайын іштей реніш болатын. Бірақ үнемі «Ақиқатты қағаз түрінде құртып жіберсе де, болашақта шындық ашылар, бірақ тірі кезімде көрмеспін» дейтін», – деді Р. Қошқарбаевтың қызы Әлия Қошқарбаева.\n\nРахымжан бастаған шабуылшы взводтың әр жауынгері көрсеткен ерлігі үшін «Бірінші дәрежелі Ұлы Отан соғысы» орденін омырауына тақты. Ал, лейтенант Қошқарбаев Кеңес Одағының батыры атағына ұсынылса да, Қызыл Жұлдызбен ғана марапатталды. Тіпті, Кеңес Одағы тұсында Жеңіс туын бірінші болып қазақтың тігуі бос әңгіме деп есептеліп, бұл ерлік өзгенің еншісінде кетті. Тек осы жылы ғана Ресей Федерациясының сыртқы істер министрлігі Рахымжан Қошқарбаевтың қайталанбас ерлігін ресми түрде растады.\n\n«Осыдан бірнеше күн бұрын Ресей Федерациясының сыртқы істер министрлігі Ұлы Отан соғысында жеңістің туын рейхстагқа тіккен қазақ Рахымжан Қошқарбаев және татар Григорий Булатов екенін мойындады. Ресейдің әскери-тарихи институтының ғалымдары дәлелдеп: «Бұл болмайды. Шын мәнінде жеңіс туын тіккен қазақ пен татар азаматы туды бірінші тіккен» деген сөзді айтты», – деді тарихшы Сайын Борбасов.\n\nРахымжан Қошқарбаев 1924 жылы қазанның 19 жұлдызында Ақмола облысына қарасты Тайтөбе ауылының маңындағы қыстақта дүниеге келген. 1937 жылы әкесі Қошқарбай Мусин жалған жаламен «халық жауы» атанып, 13 жасар Рахымжан жетім өсті. Балалық шақпен ерте қоштасқан батыр 16 жасында өз еркімен қызыл әскер қатарына сұранады. Алайда 17 жасында ғана сапқа тұрып, 1944 жылы әскери училищені тәмамдаған бойы, Бірінші Белорус майданына аттанады.Талай ұрыста ерлігімен көзге түсіп, майдан даласының аңызына айналды.

Ол үшін жоғарғы оқу орынында 300 компьютер орны дайындалған. Білім сынағының алғашқы күнінде 590 оқушы қатысады. Одан бөлек, биыл оқушылар үшін Ұлттық біріңғай тестті екі рет тапсыруға мүмкіндік бар. Яғни мемлекеттік білім гранты үшін аз бал жинаса, маусым айында тағы бір мәрте сынақтан өтуге өтініш бере алады.

Мұндай жағдайда оқушылар мектеп мұғалімдерімен келісу арқылы тест тапсыратын уақытты басқа күнге шегеруіне болады. Өтінім электронды форматта жүргізелді. Жалпы Ұлттық біріңғай тестілеуді тапсыру 90 күнге созылады», – деді  қалалық санитарлық-эпидемиологиялық бақылау департаментінің бөлім басшысы  Дина Суханберлиева.\n\nНаш сайт - http://www.almaty.tv/\nТелеканал Алматы в социальных сетях:\n1 канал Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/user/AlmatyUS\n2 канал Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/AlmatyTVNews\nFacebook RUS - https://www.facebook.com/almaty.tv\nFacebook KAZ - https://www.facebook.com/almaty.tv.kaz\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/almaty_tv\ninstagram - https://www.instagram.com/almaty.tv","title":"11 мыңнан аса оқушы: Алматыда ертең ҰБТ басталады (05.05.21)"},"publishedAt":"2021-05-05T19:21:13Z","tags":["Алматы ТВ","Almaty tv","Новости южной столицы","новости Казахстана","спортивные новости","новости шоу бизнеса","Южная столица","Акимат","Коронавирус","Коронавирус в Казахстане","Коронавирус в Алматы","Карантин","Карантин Казахстан","Карантин в Казахстане","Коронавирус в Астане","казахстан","жулдыздар"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ohzR-r9mFlg/default.jpg","width":120},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ohzR-r9mFlg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ohzR-r9mFlg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ohzR-r9mFlg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ohzR-r9mFlg/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"title":"11 мыңнан аса оқушы: Алматыда ертең ҰБТ басталады (05.05.21)"}}],"kind":"youtube#videoListResponse","pageInfo":{"resultsPerPage":10,"totalResults":10}},{"etag":"xIPtVi2dBt7V5A0Vvvb7ls_u6c8","items":[{"contentDetails":{"caption":"false","contentRating":{},"definition":"hd","dimension":"2d","duration":"PT51M14S","licensedContent":true,"projection":"rectangular"},"etag":"uXoXl2PW-sTz17TubSGHGCx5RCU","id":"TKijDBBsj9Y","kind":"youtube#video","snippet":{"categoryId":"24","channelId":"UCmOCpBKeoBPp-HwarhIBA2g","channelTitle":"Best Documentary","defaultAudioLanguage":"en","defaultLanguage":"en","description":"Charlemagne from Latin Carolus Magnus, or Charles \"the Great\" (in German Karl der Große), was born approximately around 742-748 and died January 28, 814 in Aix-la-Chapelle.

Qazaq TV News\n\n#Kazakhstan #COVID19vaccination #COVID19 #vaccine\n\nThe cities of Almaty, Shymkent and Nur-Sultan, as well as Turkistan, Almaty and Karagandy regions are leading in terms of immunization rates.\n\nCoronavirus vaccination is picking up in Kazakhstan. Over 400,000 people in the country have already received both doses of the antiviral vaccine. The cities of Almaty, Shymkent and Nur-Sultan, as well as Turkistan, Almaty and Karagandy regions are leading in terms of immunization rates. This was stated by Kazakh Health Minister Alexey Tsoy at a plenary meeting of the Mazhilis, the Lower House of the Kazakh Parliament.\n\n“We imported 2.3 million doses of vaccines to Kazakhstan in April. To date, nearly 1.4 million citizens have been vaccinated with the first component. All regions of Kazakhstan have vaccines. About 1,400 vaccination points are organized in large shopping malls. The second dose inevitably follows the first one. Citizens receive the second shot 21 days after the first,” said Alexey Tsoy, Kazakh Health Minister.\n\nA serious amount of money, over 265 billion tenge (US$619 million) was allocated from the state budget for measures aimed at fighting the spread of COVID-19 this year. They will cover the expenses related to bonuses for health workers due to coronavirus, conducting PCR testing, procuring personal protective equipment, conducting clinical trials of a domestic vaccine and completing the construction of a biopharmaceutical plant in Zhambyl region. It is expected to open this summer. The plant will produce immunobiological medicines, including Kazakh-made vaccine QazVac.\n\n“We will get 50,000 doses of the vaccine at the Research Institute for Biological Safety Problems every month, with an increase to 100,000 doses in a month. In the future, when the platform will be launched in Zhambyl region, the plant will be able to provide nearly 60 million doses a year. That will happen roughly at the end of the year. We need to conduct a GMP inspection, and for that we need to launch a full-fledged production and produce a sample batch. After that, we can evaluate the production and allow the plant to operate,” Tsoy noted.\n\nThis plant plans to produce vaccines not only against coronavirus, but also against brucellosis, dermatitis, bird flu and swine influenza.\n\nQazaq TV: бізді спутниктік арна арқылы және Youtube, әлеуметтік желілерден көріңіздер.

Qazaq TV News\n\n#Kazakhstan #Uzbekistan #AsianSchengen #Tajikistan #Kyrgyzstan\n\nThe new mechanism will make it easier for tourists to go through visa, customs and border barriers when travelling between the neighbouring states. \n\nThe Silk Road countries will have their own ‘Schengen’. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are at the first stage of considering the introduction of the Silk Road multi-entry tourist e-visa, Sputnik Kazakhstan reported. The new mechanism will make it easier for tourists to go through visa, customs and border barriers when travelling between the neighbouring states. While now foreigners need to obtain two separate visas to travel, for example, to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, then the new system will make this task more simple. Currently, it is the regulatory and technical issues that are being addressed. The list of countries whose nationals will be able to apply for visas has already been agreed upon. The developers plan to complete all work by the end of this year. The initiative was well-received in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.\n\nQazaq TV: бізді спутниктік арна арқылы және Youtube, әлеуметтік желілерден көріңіздер.

Qazaq TV News\n\n#Kazakhstan #Uzbekistan #AsianSchengen #Tajikistan #Kyrgyzstan\n\nThe new mechanism will make it easier for tourists to go through visa, customs and border barriers when travelling between the neighbouring states. \n\nThe Silk Road countries will have their own ‘Schengen’. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are at the first stage of considering the introduction of the Silk Road multi-entry tourist e-visa, Sputnik Kazakhstan reported. The new mechanism will make it easier for tourists to go through visa, customs and border barriers when travelling between the neighbouring states. While now foreigners need to obtain two separate visas to travel, for example, to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, then the new system will make this task more simple. Currently, it is the regulatory and technical issues that are being addressed. The list of countries whose nationals will be able to apply for visas has already been agreed upon. The developers plan to complete all work by the end of this year. The initiative was well-received in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.\n\nQazaq TV: бізді спутниктік арна арқылы және Youtube, әлеуметтік желілерден көріңіздер.

Kejriwal thanked the Prime Minister for allocating 700 MT of oxygen, but at the same time, he has urged PM Modi to ensure that Delhi continues to receive the supply of 700 MT per day.\n\nThis development assumes significance as Delhi has been experiencing an acute shortage of medical oxygen required to treat COVID-19 patients, amid the alarming surge of COVID-19 cases in the national capital. The Supreme Court on Thursday directed the Centre to supply 700 MT to the national capital, as demanded by the Delhi government.\n\nThe bench comprising of Justices DY Chandrachud \u0026 MR Shah on Thursday observed Centre's formula for Delhi was 'a gross underestimation of what Delhi requires'. In response, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta representing the Centre has warned that if it allocates 700 MT to Delhi, other states will face a shortage. He stated that if the Centre is ordered to supply 700 MT to Delhi, it may result in adverse consequences for other States beyond the capacity of the Centre.

Kejriwal thanked the Prime Minister for allocating 700 MT of oxygen, but at the same time, he has urged PM Modi to ensure that Delhi continues to receive the supply of 700 MT per day.\n\nThis development assumes significance as Delhi has been experiencing an acute shortage of medical oxygen required to treat COVID-19 patients, amid the alarming surge of COVID-19 cases in the national capital. The Supreme Court on Thursday directed the Centre to supply 700 MT to the national capital, as demanded by the Delhi government.\n\nThe bench comprising of Justices DY Chandrachud \u0026 MR Shah on Thursday observed Centre's formula for Delhi was 'a gross underestimation of what Delhi requires'. In response, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta representing the Centre has warned that if it allocates 700 MT to Delhi, other states will face a shortage. He stated that if the Centre is ordered to supply 700 MT to Delhi, it may result in adverse consequences for other States beyond the capacity of the Centre.
