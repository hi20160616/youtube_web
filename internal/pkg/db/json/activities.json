Есть погибшие и раненые с обеих сторон... Обстановка накалилась из-за спорной территории между таджикским анклавом Ворух в Баткенской области Кыргызстана и \"материковым\" Таджикистаном.

وصفته بخطاب المواجهة، واتخاذ خطوات عملية لتصحيح العلاقات الثنائية مع موسكو.\r\nقالت نائبة المتحدثة باسم البيت الأبيض إن عملية الانسحاب من أفغانستان مستمرة.\r\nوأضافت أن وزير الدفاع أمر بنشر مؤقت لقوات خاصة، بغرض توفير حماية لعملية الانسحاب، بينما ستقيّم القيادة المركزية الوسطى للجيش الأمريكي عملية الانسحاب، وسيكون بإمكانها زيادة قوة الحماية وفق الحاجة لذلك.\r\n============\r\n▶▶ Follow us

Roosevelt, has been the standard to gauge a president's immediate progress. President Joe Biden entered office in January with the goal to tamp down a raging pandemic, fix a broken economy that left millions unemployed and reestablish the trans-Atlantic relationship.\n\nPresident Biden's first major promise was to ensure that he would administer 100 million shots in his first 100 days. Once seen as an overly ambitious goal, he passed that mark after 58 days in office. In March, he raised the target to 200 million shots in arms, which he reached seven days before the 100 day-mark. In the US, 29% of the population has been fully vaccinated and over 40% have at least been given one shot.\n\nBiden has had to walk a tightrope when it comes to foreign policy. The stormy relationship that the Trump administration had with longtime allies has been more fluid since he entered office in January. Biden has put an emphasis on reconnecting with the US's previous allies, like the EU. Biden's remarks at the Munich Security Conference and Secretary of State Antony Blinken's two separate trips to Brussels to meet with NATO allies have been an indication that they are making serious attempts to reconnect the trans-Atlantic alliance.\n\nBiden moved quickly by sticking to his promise to reenter the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, which President Trump announced the US would withdraw from in 2017. As part of the pact, Biden has committed the US to cutting greenhouse gases in half by 2030. However, it is below the commitments made by the European Union and the United Kingdom. For Biden to achieve any of his climate goals, it will be up to whether a divided Congress can pass his multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure bill that is making its way through the Capitol. The plan will see investment in electric vehicles and clean-energy technology.\n\nThe first weeks of Biden's presidency were focused on an economy that was in danger of collapsing due to the coronavirus pandemic. With unemployment and jobless claims at record highs, he was able to push through — without Republican support — the trillion-dollar rescue plan, which sent $1,400 (€1,150) checks to the pockets of each American household. Due to the vaccination rollout and the implementation of the American Rescue Plan, the job market added nearly 1 million jobs in March, bringing down the unemployment rate to 6%. Last April, the unemployment rate was hovering around 14%. Still, the employment numbers are still below pre-pandemic numbers and there are concerns about inflation rising as a result of the rescue plan, and the American people are likely to start holding the president accountable going forward.\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n#JoeBiden #100Days #BidenPresidency","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"description":"The 100-day marker, which was first used during the presidency of Franklin D.

Biden's remarks at the Munich Security Conference and Secretary of State Antony Blinken's two separate trips to Brussels to meet with NATO allies have been an indication that they are making serious attempts to reconnect the trans-Atlantic alliance.\n\nBiden moved quickly by sticking to his promise to reenter the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, which President Trump announced the US would withdraw from in 2017. As part of the pact, Biden has committed the US to cutting greenhouse gases in half by 2030. However, it is below the commitments made by the European Union and the United Kingdom. For Biden to achieve any of his climate goals, it will be up to whether a divided Congress can pass his multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure bill that is making its way through the Capitol. The plan will see investment in electric vehicles and clean-energy technology.\n\nThe first weeks of Biden's presidency were focused on an economy that was in danger of collapsing due to the coronavirus pandemic. With unemployment and jobless claims at record highs, he was able to push through — without Republican support — the trillion-dollar rescue plan, which sent $1,400 (€1,150) checks to the pockets of each American household. Due to the vaccination rollout and the implementation of the American Rescue Plan, the job market added nearly 1 million jobs in March, bringing down the unemployment rate to 6%. Last April, the unemployment rate was hovering around 14%. Still, the employment numbers are still below pre-pandemic numbers and there are concerns about inflation rising as a result of the rescue plan, and the American people are likely to start holding the president accountable going forward.\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n#JoeBiden #100Days #BidenPresidency","title":"Reshaping America?

Среди них «Лучший действующий спортсмен по олимпийским видам спорта», «Лучшая действующая спортсменка по олимпийским видам спорта», «Лучший спортсмен по не олимпийским видам спорта», «Лучшая спортсменка по не олимпийским видам спорта», «Тренер года», «Детский тренер года», «Восходящая звезда (девушка)», «Восходящая звезда (юноша)», «Спортивная династия», «Лучшая команда года».\n\nВ трех специальных номинациях — «Спортивный подвиг» и «Хранитель традиций», «За преданность Клубу» — победители были выбраны в ходе заседания созданной спортивной комиссии.","title":"Вручение ежегодной премии «Армеец года» по случаю 98-летия ЦСКА"},"publishedAt":"2021-04-29T18:42:24Z","tags":["Минобороны России","Армия России","Шойгу","Сергей Шойгу","ЦСКА","Награждения","Премии","Церемонии","Спорт"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/elLc0Y5wEdw/default.jpg","width":120},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/elLc0Y5wEdw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/elLc0Y5wEdw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/elLc0Y5wEdw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/elLc0Y5wEdw/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"title":"Вручение ежегодной премии «Армеец года» по случаю 98-летия ЦСКА"}},{"contentDetails":{"caption":"false","contentRating":{},"definition":"hd","dimension":"2d","duration":"PT1M41S","projection":"rectangular"},"etag":"_GRBLoVNWEYx7DCjsZjTBOVrI78","id":"7AdeElci2RI","kind":"youtube#video","snippet":{"categoryId":"22","channelId":"UCQGqX5Ndpm4snE0NTjyOJnA","channelTitle":"Минобороны России","defaultAudioLanguage":"ru","defaultLanguage":"ru","description":"Боевые возможности российских ЗРК С-400 и ЗРПК «Панцирь-С» продемонстрировали иностранным военным атташе на полигоне Ашулук  в Астраханской области. \n\nПолигон посетили около 80 представителей военно-дипломатического корпуса из 52 стран СНГ, Азии, Африки, Европы и Латинской Америки, аккредитованных в России.\n\nБоевые расчеты ЗРК С-400 и ЗРПК «Панцирь-С» обнаружили и уничтожили все ракеты-мишени, имитирующие аэродинамические, оперативно-тактические, тактические баллистические цели, крылатые ракеты, а также наземные цели.","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"description":"Боевые возможности российских ЗРК С-400 и ЗРПК «Панцирь-С» продемонстрировали иностранным военным атташе на полигоне Ашулук  в Астраханской области. \n\nПолигон посетили около 80 представителей военно-дипломатического корпуса из 52 стран СНГ, Азии, Африки, Европы и Латинской Америки, аккредитованных в России.\n\nБоевые расчеты ЗРК С-400 и ЗРПК «Панцирь-С» обнаружили и уничтожили все ракеты-мишени, имитирующие аэродинамические, оперативно-тактические, тактические баллистические цели, крылатые ракеты, а также наземные цели.","title":"Демонстрация боевых возможностей ЗРК С-400 и ЗРПК «Панцирь-С» иностранным военным атташе на Ашулуке"},"publishedAt":"2021-04-29T11:00:04Z","tags":["Минобороны","МеждународноеСотрудничество","ВКС","ПВО"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7AdeElci2RI/default.jpg","width":120},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7AdeElci2RI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7AdeElci2RI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7AdeElci2RI/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"title":"Демонстрация боевых возможностей ЗРК С-400 и ЗРПК «Панцирь-С» иностранным военным атташе на Ашулуке"}},{"contentDetails":{"caption":"false","contentRating":{},"definition":"hd","dimension":"2d","duration":"PT7M41S","projection":"rectangular"},"etag":"rrU1qn0R2y4t7tSe9TcYL3_z8_Y","id":"xy-cssB2jDU","kind":"youtube#video","snippet":{"categoryId":"22","channelId":"UCQGqX5Ndpm4snE0NTjyOJnA","channelTitle":"Минобороны России","defaultAudioLanguage":"ru","defaultLanguage":"ru","description":"Начальник Генерального штаба ВС РФ генерал армии Валерий Герасимов подвел итоги контрольных проверок за зимний период обучения и поставил задачи на подготовительный период.\n\nВсего к контрольным проверкам, проведенных в апреле в соответствии с Планом подготовки Вооруженных Сил, привлекалось более 300 тыс. военнослужащих, 35 тыс. единиц вооружения, военной и специальной техники.

бўлиб ўтди.\n\nСуҳбат аввалида давлат раҳбарлари бўлажак муҳим саналар муносабати билан бир-бирини самимий табриклаб, эзгу тилаклар билдирдилар. Жорий йилда ХХРда Хитой Коммунистик партияси ташкил топганининг 100 йиллиги, мамлакатимизда эса Ўзбекистон Республикаси мустақиллигининг 30 йиллиги кенг нишонламоқда.

Камбағалликка қарши курашиш бўйича Хитойда тўпланган катта тажрибани чуқур ўрганиш масаласида яқиндан ҳамкорликни давом эттиришга келишиб олинди.\n\nДавлатимиз раҳбари коронавирус пандемиясига қарши курашда кўрсатилган амалий ёрдам учун ХХР етакчисига самимий миннатдорлик билдирди.\n\nЎзбекистон ва Хитойнинг ваколатли идора ва ташкилотлари соғлиқни сақлаш соҳасидаги ўзаро манфаатли ҳамкорликни мустаҳкамлаб, аҳолини оммавий эмлаш бўйича биргаликдаги самарали ишларни кенгайтирадилар.\n\nЎзбекистон Президенти “Ягона Хитой” сиёсатини ҳамда “уч ёвуз куч” – терроризм, экстремизм ва сепаратизмга қарши курашиш борасидаги саъй-ҳаракатларни доимо қўллаб-қувватлашини яна бир бор таъкидлади.\n\n“Бир макон, бир йўл” ташаббуси доирасидаги самарали мулоқот, шу жумладан минтақада муҳим инфратузилмавий лойиҳаларни, улар қаторида “ХХР – Қирғизистон - Хитой” автомобиль ва темир йўлларини қуриш лойиҳасини илгари суриш ишлари давом этаётгани қайд этилди.

Муҳим қўшма дастур ва лойиҳаларни амалга ошириш давом этмоқда. Мамлакатларимиз яқин йилларда товар айирбошлаш ҳажмини 10 миллиард долларга етказиш, шунингдек, экспорт ва импорт кўрсаткичларининг мутаносиблигини таъминлаш сари муваффақиятли ҳаракат қилмоқдалар.

Сенаторлар құжатты талқылау барысында орман өсіру мәселесіне қатысты өзгерістер мен толықтырулар енгізу керектігін атап өтті.\n\nЗаң жобасына сәйкес шетелдіктерге ауыл шаруашылығы жерлері сатылмайды және жалға берілмейді. Қазіргі кезде шетелдіктердің қатысуы бар 7 кәсіпорын шамамен 75 мың гектар жерді жалға алып отыр. Бұл учаскелер Жамбыл, Павлодар, Атырау, Ақмола облыстарында орналасқан. Олармен жасалған келісімшарттардың мерзімі 2025 жылы аяқталады. Кейін шарт бұзылады.\n\nЕгер аталмыш заң жобасы қабылданса, жер телімдерін тек Қазақстан азаматтары мен шетелдік қатысуы жоқ отандық кәсіпорындар ғана иеленетін болады.\n\nQazaq TV: бізді спутниктік арна арқылы және Youtube, әлеуметтік желілерден көріңіздер.

Біздегі режим сондай. Оған қоса бағдарламамыз әрқашан дайын. Сондықтан еш қиындықсыз байқауға видеоны жазып шықтық. Оркестрдің шеберлігін гран-при және I орынға лайық деп тапқандары қуанышты.

He makes various items, including furniture and musical instruments. A two-string dombyra by a craftsman from the Zhambyl region is in popular demand. He makes it from three types of wood: oak, spruce and pine. That’s the secret to making the instrument sound particularly loud, he said. Omarov is respected among the dombyra players for such a good quality of the instruments he makes.\n\n“The woodwork is very durable. If the wood is of high quality, then an item will last a long time, and if not, then it will quickly become useless. Making this musical instrument is not easy,  it is important to observe all the proportions as the sound depends on it,” noted Sultanai Niyetkabylov, a dombyra player.\n\nResident of Turkistan region Kurmanali Agadilov recreates ancient horse harnesses. According to a legend, the nomads had 30 types of them. A craftsman managed to recreate 23. For this he had to study archival materials. Recreating historical objects is a responsible job that requires accuracy, Agadilov assures. It takes him six months to make only one saddle. Like the ancient nomads, he retains all manual processing technology. As a result, it is hard to distinguish Agadilov’s works from museum exhibits. He plans to teach the craft to the younger generation, so that the ancestral traditions are not forgotten over time.\n\n“There are only a maximum of five or six types of Kazakh harnesses in the national museum, as well as in the museums of Almaty and Turkistan, although there were much more. Kazakhs are the only nation to have used more than 30 types of horse harnesses. A horse means a lot to a Kazakh. We need to develop equestrian tourism and harness the horses with ancient Kazakh harnesses. Also, we need a special school that has all the facilities to teach children this kind of craft,” Agadilov said.\n\nQazaq TV: бізді спутниктік арна арқылы және Youtube, әлеуметтік желілерден көріңіздер.

The government resigned at the end of 2019 after months of sometimes violent protests, but the economic situation is still deteriorating. The Lebanese currency is in freefall, the price of food is rocketing and to make matters worse, the number of coronavirus infections is rising dramatically. The people saw the explosion in Beirut’s port area on August 4 as another symbol of political failure. More than 170 people were killed and around 6,000 people injured, and an estimated $15 billion worth of damage done. Documents show that the authorities were aware of the improper storage of the highly explosive ammonium nitrate, which is why Nour Bassam and her fiancé Hussein Achi are not giving up. The young couple have been fighting for political change since last fall. Immediately after the explosion, Hussein and his organization, \"Min Tishreen” set up an emergency aid center in the ruins of the Mar Michael district. But Hussein is concerned with more than distributing food and medicines and rebuilding the destroyed city. While many of his friends are deserting their country, he wants to establish a new political culture in his homeland. Hussein senses the people’s anger at the country's old political elite. Will they succeed in asserting themselves against their corrupt rulers?\"\n\n[This documentary has been reuploaded due to technical issues.
