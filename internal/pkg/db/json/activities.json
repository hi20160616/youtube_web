Причины трагедии сейчас устанавливают.\nhttps://www.ktk.kz/ru/news/video/2021/04/26/178632/\n\n\n▶▶▶ Подпишись на канал: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2V6FWPzlusFQSXbAVUi3iQ\n\nYouTube канал КТК жаңалықтары ► https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClkBhzbbWhUxsNqNVwdHZPA?view_as=subscriber\n\nКТК в социальных сетях:\nFacebook  ►https://www.facebook.com/ktk.kz/\n                    ► https://www.facebook.com/kazKTK/?fref=ts\nInstagram  ► http://instagram.com/ktktv/ \n                     ► https://www.instagram.com/ktktvkz/\nВконтакте ►  https://vk.com/ktk_kz \n                     ►  https://vk.com/ktknewskaz\nTwitter ► https://twitter.com/ktk_news \n              ► https://twitter.com/KTKnewsKAZ\nОдноклассники ► https://ok.ru/ktknews\nTelegram ► https://t.me/ktknews","title":"Стрелок из «Бухар Жырау Тауэрс» четыре года назад обвинялся в похищении отца"},"publishedAt":"2021-04-26T16:26:09Z","tags":["телеканал КТК","Казахстан","Последние новости","новости сегодня","Новости КТК","новости Казахстана сегодня","Новости КТК сегодня","КТК news","news","ктк прямой эфир","ктк Новости прямой эфир","мировые новости","новости Мира на сегодня","Новости Мира и Казахстана сегодня"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AkwxwtIqP9s/default.jpg","width":120},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AkwxwtIqP9s/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AkwxwtIqP9s/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AkwxwtIqP9s/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AkwxwtIqP9s/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"title":"Стрелок из «Бухар Жырау Тауэрс» четыре года назад обвинялся в похищении отца"}},{"contentDetails":{"caption":"false","contentRating":{},"definition":"hd","dimension":"2d","duration":"PT47M28S","projection":"rectangular"},"etag":"ThABvQyVusa6tFbHj2Wr4a9qmTw","id":"0FMbOw_xAO4","kind":"youtube#video","snippet":{"categoryId":"25","channelId":"UC2V6FWPzlusFQSXbAVUi3iQ","channelTitle":"KTK TV","defaultAudioLanguage":"kk","description":"Бүгінгі бүлдіршін - ертеңгі болашақ!

Con la llegada de Bitcoin, la principal moneda digital del mundo, por primera vez en la historia el dinero ya no está controlado por los bancos o los gobiernos, sino por las personas que lo utilizan.

El Bitcoin es visto por muchos como la siguiente evolución lógica de estas monedas, y una muy deseable. Bitcoin, junto con una interfaz conocida como blockchain, es una red completamente descentralizada que elimina todos los intermediarios del proceso de intercambio de divisas. Este es uno de los principales factores que lo diferencian de las transacciones con los bancos tradicionales o las compañías de tarjetas de crédito, y es una razón importante por la que estas instituciones firmemente establecidas se ven amenazadas por la creciente popularidad de la criptodivisa. La red es especialmente útil para quienes no son miembros activos del sistema bancario, pero sus beneficios trascienden las necesidades del individuo. Como se detalla en la película, los países inseguros en cuanto a la moneda utilizan el bitcoin para evitar lidiar con gobiernos corruptos y sistemas bancarios centrales infestados de codicia. Muchas de las regiones más ricas del mundo dudan a la hora de realizar transacciones financieras con países del tercer mundo debido al fraude desenfrenado de las tarjetas de crédito. Bitcoin elimina este riesgo y, por tanto, abre un nuevo campo de revitalización para estas naciones empobrecidas. Increíblemente, también puede utilizarse para mejorar las normas de privacidad, proteger la integridad de las elecciones nacionales y ayudar a las familias que luchan en todo el mundo a conseguir derechos de propiedad. La película se sumerge de lleno en la respuesta a los críticos más acérrimos del bitcoin, incluso en cuestiones relacionadas con la resistencia de la tecnología si llegara a crecer mucho más allá de las expectativas en un futuro próximo, y las seguridades que existen para evitar el fraude generalizado.

The minimum hourly rate will then rise annually to keep up with inflation.\n\n\n“It will improve the economic security of families and make progress toward reversing decades of income inequality,” the White House said in a fact sheet.\n\n\nThe order will likely face opposition in the business community, which has argued that forcing companies to pay at least $15 will stifle job growth in an economy still recovering from the pandemic. Large corporations that do business with the government also have resisted procurement executive orders with labor mandates in the past by taking the administration to court.\n\n\nThe executive order fulfills the president’s first-week commitment to mandate by his 100th day in office a $15 federal contractor minimum wage, which the White House estimates will apply to “hundreds of thousands” of workers.

The new ‘Woven City’ near Japan’s Mount Fuji envisions a fully autonomous future. \n\nIn late February, Toyota Motor Corp. President Akio Toyoda gathered with a handful of Shinto priests in a white tent at the foot of Mount Fuji. The group prayed — as is customary when embarking on new builds in Japan — for the smooth completion of a new city to be designed and built by the world’s largest automaker.\n\nAt the site of a recently shuttered factory, Toyoda commented on the significance of replacing a plant that’s churned out cars since the ‘60s with a 175-acre community to test future technologies such as autonomous vehicles. “It’s a new chapter in our story and in our industry,” Toyoda, grandson of the carmaker’s founder, said in an online video commemorating the groundbreaking.\n\n\nBy 2040, a fleet of more than 30 million self-driving vehicles are estimated to be driving on roads globally. Yet today, even the most advanced autonomous features are limited and require driver supervision. Executives and industry experts say the missing link is cities, which need to be wired to funnel massive amounts of data to cars in order for them to meaningfully drive themselves.\n\nToyota Woven City\nAn impression of Toyota's Woven City.Source: Toyota Motor Corp.\nThat’s why Toyota is building its sensor-laden “Woven City” from the ground up a two-hour drive outside of Tokyo. There, Toyota will test autonomous vehicles for transport, deliveries and mobile shops alongside the city’s hand-picked residents as a kind of living laboratory. When construction is completed in 2024, it will seek to offer a model of what urban centers around the world could look like in the age of autonomous transport. Doing so, of course, will require convincing a broader population.\n\nRight now, limited automated driving is achieved by having sensors onboard cars draw information from their environment. Feeding such information back to vehicles will be “the next big leap forward,” says Hiroki Kuriyama, senior vice president of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. Japan’s top telecommunications company is partnering with Toyota to develop the technology needed for autonomous car-supporting smart hubs.\n\nThe idea, Kuriyama says, is to use sensors and cameras scattered throughout roads, traffic lights and buildings — and perhaps even data from mobile phones — to gather information on everything from pedestrian traffic to precipitation. That massive data stream will then be processed via optical networks, data centers and the cloud to create a digital “twin,” or mirror image, of the living city. The virtual, synthesized data can then be fed to cars, letting them safely navigate through the real world without human intervention, according to Kuriyama.\n\nThe name Woven City is a nod to Toyota’s origins as a manufacturer of automatic looms, and refers to the stitching together of software, services, vehicles and streets. All that will guide the company’s autonomous “E-palettes” — transparent shipping container-like vehicles that can accommodate as many as 20 passengers with seats that fold up so that the interior can be re-purposed. E-palettes will run through the city using autonomous vehicle lanes, providing shared transportation, delivering packages and acting as mobile storefronts.\n\nBeyond futuristic mobility options, the city will also feature smart homes that take out trash and restock refrigerators automatically, according to Toyota. The entire ecosystem will also be powered by hydrogen. It’s a big and ambitious bet for the automaker — although no investment figures have been disclosed, costs are likely to run upwards of a billion dollars. To help fund the project, Toyota said last month it would sell as much as 500 billion yen ($4.6 billion) in “Woven Planet Bonds,” the biggest such issue at the time to be used in part for the new city.\n\nTo watch complete coverage on Bloomberg Quicktake 24/7, visit http://www.bloomberg.com/qt/live, or watch on Apple TV, Roku, Samsung Smart TV, Fire TV and Android TV on the Bloomberg app.\n\nHave a story to tell?

But activists, opposition politicians and critics called it a deliberate attempt to stifle free speech, pointing out that the virus was at that time mostly under control in the city and that larger groups regularly gather in public without any issues from the authorities.\n\nFor the past 30+ years, residents of the semi-autonomous city had held a candlelight vigil that draws tens of thousands of attendees for an annual memorial to those who lost their lives when China’s leadership ordered troops to fire on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing’s central square and the nearby streets. Estimates of the dead have ranged from hundreds to thousands: there’s never been an independent investigation.\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8Gm​\n\nBloomberg Quicktake brings you live global news and original shows spanning business, technology, politics and culture.

Ауруханада бір аптадан аса жатқан жігіт сол күйі тілге келмей қайтыс болды. Ал, оның өліміне кінәлі деп 6 адам айыпталды. Бір жылға жалғасқан тергеу аяқталып, ақыры сот іске нүкте қойды. Бір баланы топтасып ұрған бозбалалар 6 жылдан 8 жылға дейін бас бостандығынан айырылды.\n\nҚұрдастары шлакоблокпен ұрып өлтірді деген студент ісіне ақыры сот нүкте қойды. Бүгін өткен соңғы сот отырысына жәбірленуші мен сотталушылардың ата-аналары түгел жиналды. Үкімді тағатсыздана күткен олар сот шешімі оқыла бастағаннан көз жасын тыя алған жоқ. Ал, сотталушылар болса, берілген мерзімді естігенде жанын қоярға жер таппай кетті. Үкімге уақытша ұстау абақтысынан онлайн қатысқан олар отырған орнынан тұрып, теңселіп кетті.\n\nСонымен 17 жастағы шымкенттік студентті топтасып өлтірді деген айыппен 6 жігіт бас бостандығынан айырылды. Ең азы 6 жыл арқаласа, ең көбі 8 жылға сотталды. Судья сөзінше, ең көп мерзімді алған жігіттің 8 жылға сотталуына оның кәмелет жасына толуы себеп болған. Ал, қалған қылмыскерлердің барлығы күдікке ілінгенде 18 жасқа толмаған екен.\n\n«Бұл жерде көрсетілген ең ауыр жаза кәмелетке толмағандарға 10 жылдан аса тағайындалмайды. Сондықтан 2,3 бөлігімен жаза тағайындалады. Ол 10 жылдан санайтын болсақ, 6 жыл 8 айдан жаза тағайындалады кәмелетке толмағандарға. Бұл жерде 1 сотталушы қылмыс болып қойғанда 18-ге толып қойған болатын. Төбелестен 1 ай бұрын. Сондықтан ол балаға 8 жыл бас бостандығынан айыру жазасы тағайындалды», – деді қалалық кәмелетке толмағандардың істері жөніндегі мамандандырылған ауданаралық сотының судьясы Дәурен Сайханов.\n\nБірақ соттың бұл үкімімен құрдастарының қолынан қайтыс болған Абзал Уткуровтың ағасы келіспейді. Сөзінше, туған бауырының өліміне қатысы барларға берілген жаза тым жеңіл.\n\n«Аппеляцияға береміз. Тым жеңіл жаза берді. 106-баппен кем дегенде 8 жылдан беру керек еді. Әрқайсысына 8 жылдан беруі керек еді. Үсіпбаев Жанболатқа ғана 8 жыл берді. Бәрі бірдей қылмыс жасады. Толық үкім шығарғанын қалаймын», – деді жәбірленуші Алмаз Уткуров.\n\nАл, сотталғандардың жақындары болса, берілген мерзімді тым көп деп отыр. Тіпті, сөздерінше, нағыз кінәлілер бостандықта екен. Осылай деп жәбірленуші жақтың жағасын алған ата-аналар сот үкіміне қарсы. Бәрібір өз шындығымызды орнатамыз деген олар соттан кейін шу шығарды.\n\n«Біздің балалар кінәсіз. Ол жерде тастың бір ударымен өлген ол бала. Дұрыс па? Солай экспертизада да бар. Біздің балалар кінәсіз. Неге ұрған бала 6 жыл алады да, неге біздің балалар 8 жыл алады? Бұл әділетсіз», – деді сотталушының әпкесі Сапаркүл Үсинбаева.\n\nЕске салайық, шымкенттіктердің жағасын ұстатқан оқиға былтыр болған еді.

После многочасовых переговоров спецназ провёл штурм, но взять живым стрелка не удалось, передает корреспондент Almaty.tv.\n\nC камер видеонаблюдения запечатлён момент стрельбы по охраннику, который падает у будки. После чего вооружённый ружьём мужчина свободно перемещается по территории ЖК, идёт в подземный паркинг, а после поднимается на 17 этаж и баррикадируется в своей квартире. На место происшествия стянуты все экстренные службы и даже армейские подразделения. Жителей в срочном порядке эвакуировали в безопасное место.\n\n\"Он вытащил свои диваны в подъезд. КСК неоднократно просило его убрать диваны, но было без толку. Потом охранники вынесли диваны на улицу, в тот день шел дождь и это вызвало гнев мужчины\", - рассказала жительница ЖК Гульбагира Кертаева. \n\n\"Вот, я вперед шла, а он назад. Он мог бы и в меня стрельнуть. Ну, я прошла к себе домой, а потом хлопок вижу, что вот тот лежит. А он спокойно прошел в паркинг\", - поделилась жительница ЖК Нурилля Тохтарбаева. \n\nМужчина периодически стрелял в сторону лестничной площадки, находясь в квартире. Звуки были слышны даже снаружи.\n\nДверь, в которой забаррикадировался 56-летний житель города после конфликта с охранником, опечатана. За время переговоров он успел произвести около 30 выстрелов в лестничный проход. Вокруг видны следы выстрелов, выбит свет.\n\nПереговоры со стрелком продолжались несколько часов. Когда стало понятно, что сдаваться он не намерен, прозвучала команда на штурм. Но взять вооруженного человека не удалось. Он спрыгнул с окна 17 этажа. Прибывшие к месту происшествия медики констатировали его смерть.\n\n\"Боевое оружие полицейскими не применялось в ходе спецоперации. Применялось оружие нелетального воздействия - это светозвуковые и шумовые гранаты. В результате, побоявшись ответственности, данный подозреваемый решил покончить жизнь самоубийством, выбросившись из окна своей квартиры на 17 этаже, в которой он заперся\", - заявила официальный представитель городского ДП Салтанат Азирбек.\n\nПострадавшего охранника ЖК госпитализировали городскую клиническую больницу №7. По словам врачей, его состояние не вызывает опасений.\n\n\"Пациент поступил в больницу со сквозным пулевым ранением в области левого коленного сустава. В экстренном порядке была проведена операция. На данный момент состояние пациента удовлетворительное\", - сообщил врач-травматолог Бауржан Отешев. \n\nВыяснилось, что погибший был гражданином России, жил на съёмной квартире в ЖК с 2016 года, а несколько лет назад от него ушла семья.

Двухэтажные дома стоят до сих пор, а деревья, посаженные 55 лет назад, сегодня дарят местным жителям тенистую прохладу.\n\nИстория жилого массива и рассказы очевидцев тех далеких и тревожных дней в сюжете Sputnik Узбекистан.\n\nПодписывайтесь на наш канал: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnYDecThu9q83mSS9KyAUXQ?annotation_id=annotation_2574744981\u0026feature=iv\u0026src_vid=_XtPyvdLuk4\u0026sub_confirmation=1\nМы в Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/sputnikuzbekistan/\nМы в Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sputnik.uzbekistan/\nМы в Одноклассниках: https://ok.ru/sputnikuzbekistan\nМы в Telegram: https://t.me/sputnikuzbekistan","title":"Как строился жилой микрорайон для пострадавших от Ташкентского землетрясения"},"publishedAt":"2021-04-26T16:49:36Z","tags":["Sputnik","Спутник","Узбекистан","Uzbekistan","Uzbekiston","Ташкент","узбекский","узбеки","новости","видео","актуальное","стороительство","Ташкентское землетрясение","массив","Спутник"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uHmHylIuwsw/default.jpg","width":120},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uHmHylIuwsw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uHmHylIuwsw/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uHmHylIuwsw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uHmHylIuwsw/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"title":"Как строился жилой микрорайон для пострадавших от Ташкентского землетрясения"}},{"contentDetails":{"caption":"false","contentRating":{},"definition":"hd","dimension":"2d","duration":"PT1M16S","licensedContent":true,"projection":"rectangular"},"etag":"blog0e6OIpxJBBQnwi9SGGhiZEM","id":"3UEaEB1DJ8g","kind":"youtube#video","snippet":{"categoryId":"25","channelId":"UCnYDecThu9q83mSS9KyAUXQ","channelTitle":"Sputnik Узбекистан","defaultAudioLanguage":"uz","description":"В преддверии дня Победы в Крыму пройдет ежегодный международный музыкальный фестиваль «Дорога на Ялту», на котором будут звучать песни военных лет на языках тех стран, откуда приехали участники. \n29 апреля в Ялте состоится полуфинал конкурса.

Регистон майдони Баҳодир Ялангтўш даврида шаклланган.\n«Регистон» деган сўз форс тилидан олинган бўлиб, «қумли жой» деган маънони билдиради, «рег» - қум, «истон» - туриш жойи демакдир. Тарихий маълумотлар ва аниқ илмий ашёвий далилларга асосланиб, айтиш мумкин-ки, бу ердан жанубий шарқдан, шимолий ғарбга томон катта ариқ оқиб ўтган, вақт ўтиб ариқ қуригандан сўнг, ўрнида қумлоқ жой қолган. Ана шу асосда «Регистон» деган сўз келиб чиққан.\nАмир Темур ҳукмронлиги даврида ҳозирги Регистон майдони ўрнида марказий бозор бўлган. Ана ўша даврдан Самарқанд жаҳонга машҳур илму фан ва ҳунармандчилик маркази сифатида дунёга танилган.\nБу ерга етти иқлимдан донишмандлар, олиму фузалолар келиб Мирзо Улуғбек атрофига тўпланишган. Сон-саноқсиз зиёратчилар, Шоҳи Зинда мақбарасига келган савдогарлар шаҳарни томоша қилиш билан бирга машҳур Самарқанд қоғозини ва бошқа кўплаб турли ноёб ҳунармандчилик ҳамда яна қатор ноёб молларни харид қилишга келганлар.\nБарча йўллар пойтахт Самарқанд шаҳрининг савдо-ҳунармандчилик маркази ҳисобланган Регистонда бир-бири билан туташган. У ҳунармандлар кўчаси бўлиб, заргарлар растаси орқали Арк билан боғланган.\nАсрлар давомида Регистондаги иншоотлар уч марта ўзгарди. Дастлаб бош кийимлар сотиладиган усти ёпиқ гумбазли тим қурилади.\nУлуғбек ҳукмронлиги даврига келиб майдонда қайтадан режалаштириш ишлари амалга оширилади.

Ўрта Осиё ва Эронда яшаган, турли ҳукмдорлар пайтида табиб ва вазир бўлган. Ибн Сино рисолалари Шарқ ҳамда Ғарбда бағоят машҳур. “Тиб қонунлари” назарий ва клиник медицина энциклопедияси — юнон, рум, ҳинд ҳамда ўрта осиёлик табиблар нуқтаи-назари жамланмаси — бир неча аср давомида, ҳатто Оврупада ҳам зарур қўлланма бўлиб хизмат қилган.\nАсосий қизиқишлари – замонавий медицина янгиликлари, гомеопатия, халқ табобати, замонавий манбаларни ва медицинага оид рефератларни ўрганиш.

Бу – Инжилдан кейинги нашрдан чиққан иккинчи китоб бўлади.\nТабобат илмининг султони бўлмиш Ибн Сино Бухоро яқинидаги Афшона қишлоғида туғилган. Бизнинг вақтимизгача етиб келган ўзи ҳақидаги таржимаи холида ёзишича, “Отам Балхдан бўлган ва у ердан Бухорога сомонийлардан Нуҳ ибн Мансур ҳукмронлиги даврида келади ва у ерда ўз ишини девонхонадан бошлайди. Унинг лавозими –  Бухоро яқинидаги туман маркази бўлмиш Хармайсанни бошқариш бўлган. Шу ерларга яқин қишлоқдаги Афшоналик қизни, яъни менинг бўлажак онам Ситора – юлдузни хотинликка олади. У ерда аввал мен, кейин менинг акам дунёга келади.”\nИбн Сино форс-дорий тилида суҳбатлашувчи Ўрта Осиёлик бўлган. “Қалбга ором бериш учун” бу тилда у тез-тез тўртликлар ёзиб турган.\nИбн Синонинг ота-онасига Ҳусайн исми жуда ёққан. Шу сабабли биринчи ўғлининг исмини Ҳусайн деб қўйишган, лекин аслзодалар, одатда ўғиллари ва куньяларига фахрий ном беришган. “Шубҳасиз, менинг ўғлимнинг ўз ўғли бўлади, дея кулади Абдуллоҳ. Шундай экан, менинг ўғлим Ҳусайн азият чекмасин. Бўлажак набирам учун мен исм танлаб қўйдим – унинг исми Али бўлади. Куньяси Абу Али бўлади”. Абдуллоҳ бу фикри зое эканлигини билмаган ҳам эди. Ҳусайннинг на ўғли, на оиласи бўлади.\nБир умр карвон йўлларида шаҳарма-шаҳар кезиб, бир ҳукмдордан бошқасининг қўлига ўтиб, йўл унинг уйига, йўловчилар эса унинг яқинларига айланиб қолади. Кичкина Ҳусайн жуда қизиқувчан йигитча бўлган. “Нима учун?” сўзи – луғатидаги энг кўп ишлатиладиган сўз бўлган. Ҳусайн беш ёшга тўлганида оиласи Бухоро шаҳрига кўчиб ўтади. Болакайни бошланғич мусулмонлар мактабига жойлашади ва у ерда ўн йил таълим олади.\nХатиб Убайд синфидаги ўн бешта болакай орасида Ҳусайн энг кичиги бўлган. Қуръон оятлари, сураларни ўқувчилар араб тилида ўқишлари лозим бўлган. Кўпчилик йигитлар араб тилини базўр тушунишган. Ҳусайн ўқишни бошлаши биланоқ устозини саволлар билан кўмиб ташлайди, аммо устози шу заҳотиёқ осон жавоб қайтаради: “Қуръонни ўрган. У ердан барча саволларингга жавоб топасан.” Бир вақтнинг ўзида Ҳусайн бошқа ўқитувчи билан ҳам шуғулланиб, грамматика, услубият ва араб тилларини ўрганади.\nКунлардан бир кун кичик Ҳусайн: “Мен Қуръонни бутунлай ёд олдим. Энди савол берсам буладими?”, дейди. Устози эса жуда қаттиқ ранжийди ва “Қуръонни узоқ йиллар давомида ўрганишади ва камдан-кам мусулмонлар уни ёд олиб, уларни ҳофиз, дея улуғлашади”, дейди. “Демак, мен ҳофиз эканман!” – дея тезкор жавоб қайтаради, болакай. Адолатсиз имтихонда Ҳусайн барча сураларни бир сўз ҳам қолдирмай айтиб беради.\nҚуръонни хатиб Убайднинг ўзи ҳам ёддан билган. Шундан кейин Ҳусайн мактабга бормаган. Ўн ёшида, яъни 990 йилга бориб, Ҳусайн таълимининг бошланғич даврини якунлайди. У Қуръонни ёддан айтиб, ўз хотираси билан барчани ҳайратга солади ва араб адабиётини ниҳоятда зўр билиши билан барчани лол қолдиради. Шу вақтдан эътиборан, Ибн Сино шайҳ бўлади. Мана, шахсий таржимаи холидан парча: “Ўн ёшимда мен Қуръонни ёд олдим ва адабиёт фанини ўрганиб катта муваффақиятларга эришиб, барчани қойил қолдирдим”.\nАйтиш жоизки, болакайнинг мисли кўрилмаган қобилиятлари эрта сезилди. Уйидаги хуш ҳолат ўспириннинг маънавий юксалишига замин яратди. Ибн Синонинг отаси бадавлат ва ўқимишли, исмоилит (собиқ исломга қарши) ўқишларига яқин киши бўлганки, уни издошлари сафига қўшган. Гарчи ибн Сино исмоилитлардан бўлмаган, лекин уларнинг хутбалари маъноси билан синчкофлик ила қизиққан. Эҳтимол, Ибн Сино исмоилитлардан ўзининг Қуръонга бўлган танқидий қарашларини ўзлаштиргандур.","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"description":"\"Буюк сиймолар\" кўрсатуви\n\"Ўзбекистон тарихи\" телеканали\nАл Ҳусайн Ибн Абдуллоҳ ибн Ал-Ҳасан ибн Али Ибн Сино – буюк олим, табиб, мусиқачи. Ўрта Осиё ва Эронда яшаган, турли ҳукмдорлар пайтида табиб ва вазир бўлган. Ибн Сино рисолалари Шарқ ҳамда Ғарбда бағоят машҳур. “Тиб қонунлари” назарий ва клиник медицина энциклопедияси — юнон, рум, ҳинд ҳамда ўрта осиёлик табиблар нуқтаи-назари жамланмаси — бир неча аср давомида, ҳатто Оврупада ҳам зарур қўлланма бўлиб хизмат қилган.\nАсосий қизиқишлари – замонавий медицина янгиликлари, гомеопатия, халқ табобати, замонавий манбаларни ва медицинага оид рефератларни ўрганиш. Олимнинг ўлимидан юз йилдан ошиқ вақт ўтиб, Боғдоддаги дин ишқибозлари Ибн Синонинг фалсафий китобларини ёқиб юборишади, орадан яна бир неча аср ўтгач, Оврупада катта дастгоҳ ихтиро қилингач, “Тиб қонунлари” китобининг катта бешта томи нашрдан чиқарилган. Бу – Инжилдан кейинги нашрдан чиққан иккинчи китоб бўлади.\nТабобат илмининг султони бўлмиш Ибн Сино Бухоро яқинидаги Афшона қишлоғида туғилган. Бизнинг вақтимизгача етиб келган ўзи ҳақидаги таржимаи холида ёзишича, “Отам Балхдан бўлган ва у ердан Бухорога сомонийлардан Нуҳ ибн Мансур ҳукмронлиги даврида келади ва у ерда ўз ишини девонхонадан бошлайди.

Петербургдаги Николаев (пажлар) корпусида таълим олган (1893-96). 1898-йил Қарши, валиаҳд сифатида Кармана бекликларига ҳоким бўлган. Отаси вафотидан сўнг 1910-йил 24-декабрда Бухоро тахтига ўтирган. Унинг даврида Бухоро амирлигининг Россияга қарамлиги янада кучайди. Тараққийпарвар кучлар шунингдек, Ёш бухороликлар қаттиқ таъқиб қилинди. Биринчи Жаҳон уруши даврида Россия императори Николай ИИ уни генерал – лейтинант ҳарбий унвони билан тақдирлаган ва ўзининг генерал – адъютанти қилиб тайинлаган (1915-йил декабр). Чунки у Россияга катта миқдорда пул билан ёрдам берган эди. Бухорода 1917-йил апрел намойиши, хусусан, Колесов воқеаси (1918-йил март) дан кейин у амирлик ҳудудида 3 минг кишини жадидликда айблаб, ноҳақ қатл эттирган.\n1920-йил августда Бухоро босқини натижасида амирлик тузуми ағдариб ташланди. Сентабр ойининг ўрталарида Олимхон Шарқий Бухорога бориб, Бухоро халқининг босқинчи қизил армияга қарши олиб борган мустақиллик курашига раҳбарлик қилишга уринди. Олимхон Ҳисор вилоятини ўзига қароргоҳ қилиб, 6 ой давомида қизил аскарларга қарши курашган. Ҳисорда янги ҳукумат ташкил қилиб, бухорооликларнинг қизил аскарларга қарши олиб бораётган жанг ҳаракатларини мувоффақиятлаштиришга интилган. Олимхон Кўлоб, Ҳисор ва Душанба атрофида катта миқдордаги кучларни бирлаштиришга муваффақ бўлган. 1920-йил ноябр ойининг ўрталарида унинг қўшинлари Бойсун, Дарбанд, Шерабодни қизил аскарлардан озод қилишди. Олимхон ихтиёрига Фарғонадан ёрдамга юборилган 4 минг йигит ҳам Шарқий Бухорога етиб келади. 1921-йил 8-январда Олимхон қўшининг миқдори 25 минг кишига етган. Ҳисордан Кўлоб вилоятига келган Олимхон бутун қўшинларига Иброҳимбекни олий- бош қўмондон (Ўринбосарлар: Шарқий Бухорода – Давлатманбек ва Ғарбий Бухорода – мулла Абдулқаҳҳор) қилиб тайинлайди. Бироқ, бир қатор жангларда мағлубиятга учрагач, Олимхон Амударёнинг Чубек кечувидан Афғонистонга ўтиб кетган (1921-йил 4-март). Олимхонни Кобулга Афғонистон амири Омонуллахон қабул қилиб, доимий яшаши учун унга Қалъаий Фотуда маҳсус қароргоҳ ажратиб беради.

Петербургдаги Николаев (пажлар) корпусида таълим олган (1893-96). 1898-йил Қарши, валиаҳд сифатида Кармана бекликларига ҳоким бўлган. Отаси вафотидан сўнг 1910-йил 24-декабрда Бухоро тахтига ўтирган. Унинг даврида Бухоро амирлигининг Россияга қарамлиги янада кучайди. Тараққийпарвар кучлар шунингдек, Ёш бухороликлар қаттиқ таъқиб қилинди. Биринчи Жаҳон уруши даврида Россия императори Николай ИИ уни генерал – лейтинант ҳарбий унвони билан тақдирлаган ва ўзининг генерал – адъютанти қилиб тайинлаган (1915-йил декабр). Чунки у Россияга катта миқдорда пул билан ёрдам берган эди. Бухорода 1917-йил апрел намойиши, хусусан, Колесов воқеаси (1918-йил март) дан кейин у амирлик ҳудудида 3 минг кишини жадидликда айблаб, ноҳақ қатл эттирган.\n1920-йил августда Бухоро босқини натижасида амирлик тузуми ағдариб ташланди. Сентабр ойининг ўрталарида Олимхон Шарқий Бухорога бориб, Бухоро халқининг босқинчи қизил армияга қарши олиб борган мустақиллик курашига раҳбарлик қилишга уринди. Олимхон Ҳисор вилоятини ўзига қароргоҳ қилиб, 6 ой давомида қизил аскарларга қарши курашган. Ҳисорда янги ҳукумат ташкил қилиб, бухорооликларнинг қизил аскарларга қарши олиб бораётган жанг ҳаракатларини мувоффақиятлаштиришга интилган. Олимхон Кўлоб, Ҳисор ва Душанба атрофида катта миқдордаги кучларни бирлаштиришга муваффақ бўлган. 1920-йил ноябр ойининг ўрталарида унинг қўшинлари Бойсун, Дарбанд, Шерабодни қизил аскарлардан озод қилишди. Олимхон ихтиёрига Фарғонадан ёрдамга юборилган 4 минг йигит ҳам Шарқий Бухорога етиб келади. 1921-йил 8-январда Олимхон қўшининг миқдори 25 минг кишига етган. Ҳисордан Кўлоб вилоятига келган Олимхон бутун қўшинларига Иброҳимбекни олий- бош қўмондон (Ўринбосарлар: Шарқий Бухорода – Давлатманбек ва Ғарбий Бухорода – мулла Абдулқаҳҳор) қилиб тайинлайди. Бироқ, бир қатор жангларда мағлубиятга учрагач, Олимхон Амударёнинг Чубек кечувидан Афғонистонга ўтиб кетган (1921-йил 4-март). Олимхонни Кобулга Афғонистон амири Омонуллахон қабул қилиб, доимий яшаши учун унга Қалъаий Фотуда маҳсус қароргоҳ ажратиб беради. У Кобулда яшаса ҳам Бухородаги озодлик ҳаракатига ғоявий жиҳатдан раҳбарлик қилишда давом этди, кўрбошлар ва уламоларга турли мактублар ва қимматбаҳо совғалар жўнатиб, уларни курашга илҳомлантирган. Олимхон Кобулда ўзининг эсталикларини ёзиб тугаллайди. Умрининг охирида кўзи ожизланиб қолади, оғир дардга чалинади узоқ давом этган ҳасталиклардан сўнг у Қалъаий Фотуда вафот этади.

Qazaq TV News \n\n#Ashyq #project #Kazakhstan #Atameken #PCRtesting #entrepreneurs\n\nTo use the app, you just need to download it and enter the individual identification number. \n\nThe number of users of the Ashyq project in Kazakhstan reached 300,000. Despite the epidemiological situation, it will cover all regions from today, announced Deputy Director of Health Service Department at the “Atameken” National Chamber of Entrepreneurs, Assel Muratkhanova.\n\n“If you passed PCR testing and the result is negative, then you will have a “green” status for 72 hours. After 72 hours, or if you have not passed PCR testing at all, your status will be “blue”. If you tested positive, the status will be “red” for two weeks. It does not matter if you passed PCR testing, recovered or not, the status will remain the same for two weeks. All contacted people will have a “yellow” status,” she said.\n\nTo use the app, you just need to download it and enter the individual identification number. Then you will have the opportunity to freely visit any institution which supports the Ashyq project.\n\n“First, it makes it possible for entrepreneurs to work and run their business.

Егер 72 сағат өтсе немесе бұған дейін ешқашан ПТР тестін тапсырмасаңыз, онда «көк» мәртебесінде боласыз. Ал егер тест нәтижеңіз оң болса, яғни індетті жұқтырған болсаңыз, онда «қызыл» мәртебесі көрсетіледі. Ондай жағдайда қосымша сізді автоматты түрде 2 аптаға «қызыл» мәртебесіне жібереді.

Шараны ұйымдастырушы халықаралық деңгейдегі суретші – Маржан Әбілдина. Оның айтуынша, бұл көрме өзінің еңбектеріне ғана емес, шәкірті Ева Верченконың да туындыларын көпшілікке таныстыруды көздейді. Ұстаз бен шәкірттің бірлескен көрмесіне 66 туынды таңдалған.

Шәкіртім 6 жыл өнер мектебінде оқыды және осы жылдар аралығында түрлі картиналар салды. Сол дайын картиналардың ішінен елімізге деген махаббатты көрсете алатын, Қазақстан табиғатының тақырыбына сай келетін 12 картинаны іріктеп алдық. Осылайша, балалар өнер арқылы Отанға деген патриоттық сезімдерін білдіре алатынын түсінсе дейміз. Сондай-ақ көрмеде қойылған 44 картина – менің шығармаларым. Олар Германияда, Францияда, Оңтүстік Кореядағы көрмелерде болып қайтқан. Сонымен қатар пандемия кезінде Қазақстанда көп жұмыс істедім. Оларды да көрмеге қоюды ұйғардым.\n\nМерекелік көрме мамыр айының соңына дейін жалғасады.

Qazaq TV жаңалықтары\n\n#QazVac #вакцина #МаратШоранов #Денсаулық #вакциналау #коронавирус #Пандемия\n\nОтандық QazVac вакцинасы – вирусқа қарсы тұрақты иммунитет қалыптастыратыны дәлелденіп, Дүниежүзілік денсаулық сақтау ұйымының тізіміне енген санаулы вакциналардың бірі.\n\nОтандық QazVac вакцинасы – вирусқа қарсы тұрақты иммунитет қалыптастыратыны дәлелденіп, Дүниежүзілік денсаулық сақтау ұйымының тізіміне енген санаулы вакциналардың бірі. Осылайша Қазақстан өз вакцинасын жасап шығарған әлемдегі 10 елдің қатарына кірді. Өз кезегінде «СҚ Фармация» компаниясы мен Биологиялық қауіпсіздік жөніндегі институт жыл соңына дейін отандық вакцинаның 2 млн данасын әзірлеуге қатысты келісімге қол қойды. Алдағы уақытта препараттың ай сайын 500-600 мың дозасын дайындау жоспарланып отыр.\n\nМарат Шоранов, ҚР Денсаулық сақтау министрінің бірінші орынбасары:\n\n- Алдымен Биологиялық қауіпсіздік институтында шығарылған 50 мың доза келді. Енді Үкімет деңгейінде және мемлекеттік органдармен бірге басқа да өндірістік алаңдардың мәселелері шешілуде.\n\nБүгінде вакцинаның 6 мың дозасы Нұр-Сұлтан мен Алматы қалаларына жеткізілді. Ал 4 мың дозадан Шымкент, Қарағанды қалалары, Шығыс Қазақстан және Алматы облыстарына енді жеткізілуі керек.\n\nОтандық вакцинаның ерекшелігі сол, оны жеткізу процесі күрделі тоңазытқыш қондырғыларын қажет етпейді әрі вакцинаны 2-8 градус температурада тасымалдауға болады. Вакциналау 21 күн аралықпен екі рет жүргізіледі. Сонымен қатар екпені әзірлеушілер QazVac вирустың барлық мутацияланған түріне қарсы тұра алатынын айтады.\n\nАйта кетейік, Денсаулық сақтау министрлігінің ұсынған соңғы деректеріне сәйкес, бүгінгі күнге дейін 893 633 қазақстандық коронавирусқа қарсы екпе алған. Оның ішінде екінші дозасын 165 997 азамат салдырды.\n\nQazaq TV: бізді спутниктік арна арқылы және Youtube, әлеуметтік желілерден көріңіздер.

Шарип был освобожден от должности председателя правления «СК-Фармация» на фоне критики из-за сбоев в поставках лекарств в больницы и хранившегося месяцами на складах гуманитарного груза из-за рубежа.\n\nКАНАЛҒА ТІРКЕЛ / ПОДПИШИСЬ НА КАНАЛ: https://www.youtube.com/c/KhabarNEWS?sub_confirmation=1\n\nАРНАМЫЗДЫҢ ҮЗДІК ЖОБАЛАРЫ / ТОПОВЫЕ ПРОЕКТЫ КАНАЛА:\nОтдел журналистских расследований\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdf11Ca_10ru2Tj6vkdWuof4T0rUWiEKK\n«Бүгін» ток-шоуы\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdf11Ca_10rsjBqYQHiMh2yYr1lIYT-13\n«Khabarlas»\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdf11Ca_10rtds-wgF0HQHtM60pfDrNLz\n\n#ОбществоХабар #ВыпускНовостей #ХабарNEWS","title":"Экс-главу «СК-Фармации» обвиняют в заражении коронавирусом больше 2 тысяч медиков"},"publishedAt":"2021-04-26T16:23:09Z","tags":["Телеканал Хабар","хабар жаңалықтар","хабар новости","казахстан новости 2021","казахстан новости сегодня","казахстан новости","новости прямой эфир","новости на сегодня","новости президент","хабар","СК Фармация","заражение коронавирусом","медработники","обвинение","освобожден от должности","борьба с коронавирусом","нарушения","поставка препаратов","глава ск фармации","берик шарип"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9NyOB4BAzfA/default.jpg","width":120},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9NyOB4BAzfA/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9NyOB4BAzfA/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9NyOB4BAzfA/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9NyOB4BAzfA/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"title":"Экс-главу «СК-Фармации» обвиняют в заражении коронавирусом больше 2 тысяч медиков"}},{"contentDetails":{"caption":"false","contentRating":{},"definition":"hd","dimension":"2d","duration":"PT3M7S","licensedContent":true,"projection":"rectangular"},"etag":"DBEHhDEsJIQV2qe7qRUktpnyNzQ","id":"0oiUUP2bTTw","kind":"youtube#video","snippet":{"categoryId":"25","channelId":"UCv_UKgrCSZxdNsSpvraPksg","channelTitle":"Хабар NEWS","description":"26 апреля в столицу и Алматы доставили по 6 тысяч доз вакцины QazVac, еще по 4 тысячи – в Шымкент, Карагандинскую, Восточно-Казахстанскую и Алматинскую области.\n\nОстальные регионы пока получили по 2 тысячи доз.\n\nЖелающих получить казахстанский препарат с самого утра уже было достаточно. Что называется, поддержали отечественного производителя.\n\nВ Карагандинской поликлинике №4 прививают сегодня только QazVac. В отличие от «Спутника V» флакон рассчитан на 1 человека и вакцину не надо предварительно размораживать. А это значит, привить можно больше пациентов. Среди пришедших получить антиковидный укол много пожилых. 70-летний карагандинец Александр Беккер пришел одним из первых. Больше 20 лет он проработал в шахте. Сейчас он на пенсии, однако ведет активную жизнь, поэтому вакцинацию считает необходимой.\n\nАлександр Беккер, житель г. Караганды:\n\n— Прививаюсь, чтобы не заболеть и не заразить кого-нибудь. Я, например, считаю, что казахстанская, что российская надежные вакцины. Вообще не почувствовал даже укола, абсолютно.\n\nОлжабай Сулейменов, житель г. Караганды:\n\n— Министр здравоохранения сделал себе прививку, а почему бы мне не сделать? Если он верит в эту вакцину, я тоже буду верить. Надо снижать общий уровень заболевания в Казахстане, поэтому всем необходимо привиться.\n\nВ Северо-Казахстанскую область поступило 2000 доз двухкомпонентного отечественного препарата QazVac. Партия распределена между 4 поликлиниками областного центра и медучреждениями Мамлютки, Булаево и Кызылжарского района. Противопоказания к ней аналогичные со «Спутником V», говорят врачи. Привиться может любой желающий. \n\nКумар Кусемисов, заместитель руководителя Областного управления здравоохранения:\n\n— Это тоже инактивированная, неживая вакцина, то есть после постановки данной вакцины заболеть коронавирусом от неё нельзя. По предварительным данным, иммунитет развивается на 2 года, предположительно, стойкий иммунитет. Но время покажет. Возможно, это будет и более длительный срок.\n\nСтолько же доз казахстанской вакцины поступило в Туркестанскую область. По словам медиков, жители сами вправе выбирать антиковидный препарат для вакцинации: QazVac или «Спутник V».\n\nВакцинация антиковидным препаратом QazVac стартовала и в Кызылорде.\n\nЖангельды Шаймбетов, заместитель руководителя Областного управления здравоохранения:\n\n— Главные особенности — во-первых, это температура хранения препарата. Она составляет от +2 до +8 градусов, поэтому транспортировка осуществляется легче. Во-вторых, каждая ампула рассчитана только на одного человека. А как вы знаете, при вакцинации «Спутником V» нужно ожидать 5 человек, поскольку ампула рассчитана на 5 доз и их нужно освоить быстро.\n\nКристина Алмаскызы, корреспондент:\n\n— Казахстан вошел в десятку государств, выпускающих вакцину против COVID-19, и пятерку стран, зарегистрировавших собственные разработки.

It happened on April 26, 1986. Thirty-five years later, a group of survivors returns to the ghost city of Pripyat in northern Ukraine.\n\nA senior engineer who worked building the reactor, a maternity doctor from a local hospital, and an 11-year-old girl evacuated from Pripyat survived, as did a firefighter who served in Reactor Block 4 and an army officer who was in charge of removing radioactive debris from the reactor's roof. This documentary follows them as they return to their deserted homes for the first time. Their memories come together like pieces of a puzzle that depicts the fateful events of 1986. Firefighters and soldiers who became known as \"liquidators\" risked their lives to stabilize the site and prevent even greater radioactive contamination of Europe and the world. Only a few survived the mission. This emotional documentary recounts a major historical drama in small, intimate stories, while using never before seen archive material that the people of Pripyat had hidden in their homes.\n\n#Chernobyl #documentary #dwdocumentary\n\nـــــ\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
